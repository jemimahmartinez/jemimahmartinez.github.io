Code base for my personal website - it is a big WIP!

## TODO:

- Fix navigation bar: (currently ðŸ‘€)
    - Add transition to the navigation arrow
    - Activate `active` class to the respective section depending on where the user is on the screen
- Organise files (especially the navigation files)
- Develop for mobile view:
    - Navigation is looking off
    - My title description is cut off
- `Home` section:
    - `NavButton` (down) highlights the whole container - only want the icon to be highlighted   
- `About` section:
    - Design 
    - Develop
- `Projects` section:
    - Design
    - Develop
- `Contact` section:
    - When hovering over any of the icons, the transition affects the other icons and the 'Contact me here!' header

If you have any suggestions then feel free to email me [here](mailto:martinezjemimah@gmail.com) :)
