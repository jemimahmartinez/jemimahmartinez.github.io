Code base of my personal website - it is a big WIP!

## TODO:

    - Add transition to the navigation arrow
    - Activate `active` class to the respective section depending on where the user is on the screen
- Develop for mobile view
- Design `About` section - then develop
- Design `Projects` section - then develop
